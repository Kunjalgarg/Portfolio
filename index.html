            <h4>Full Stack Developer!</h4>
            <p>Hi, I’m Kunjal, a passionate first-year BTech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. 
                As an aspiring software developer, I am deeply fascinated by the transformative power 
                of technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. 
                My journey in programming began with curiosity and has grown into a commitment to mastering 
                the art of coding. I have hands-on experience with programming languages like Java, C, and Python, 
                which I use to build robust applications and solve complex problems. My knowledge extends to 
                web development with HTML and CSS, allowing me to create visually appealing and responsive websites. 
                Additionally, I have a solid understanding of SQL, enabling me to work effectively with databases.                
                Currently, I am honing my skills by exploring the realms of AI and software development. 
                I thrive on challenges that push me to learn and grow, whether it's building projects, 
                experimenting with algorithms, or diving into new technologies.With a keen interest in 
                innovation and a foundation of technical expertise, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
                I believe in continuous learning and am excited about the journey ahead as I work towards becoming 
                a skilled AI engineer and developer. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!

        }
      </style>
      
      <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about personal growth and 
        <br>continuous learning. I am always looking for opportunities to improve myself 
        <br>both professionally and personally. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading about 
        <br>advancements in technology, solving puzzles, and participating in hackathons 
        <br>to test my skills. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working 
        <br>with others to build meaningful projects. With a strong foundation in artificial 
        <br>intelligence and software development, I am excited about the future and the 
        <br>impact technology will have on society.</p>
    <p><br>As I continue to grow in my field, I aim to explore new areas of AI, machine 
        <br>learning, and data science, contributing to innovations that can revolutionize 
        <br>industries. I am particularly interested in using AI to solve complex problems 
        <br>related to healthcare, education, and sustainability. Let's connect and explore 
        <br>the endless possibilities of technology!</p>
